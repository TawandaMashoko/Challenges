Problem:
Approach: Heap Data Structure, we need to do 4 runs of the simulation of the gifts array, taking the remaining values and sum them up,
Solution:
class Solution:
    def pickGifts(self, gifts: List[int], k: int) -> int:

        gifts = [-g for g in gifts]
        heapq.heapify(gifts)

        for _ in range(k):
            n = -heapq.heappop(gifts)
            heapq.heappush(gifts, -floor(sqrt(n)))

        return -sum(gifts)
