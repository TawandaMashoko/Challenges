Problem: Palindrome is a number that reads the same way backward same way it reads from the start.
Approach: 
1. I turned x into a list 
2. Turned that List into a String
3. Make a Copy of it and reverse x for the case where it has a negative sign it has to read the same way backward, and all of it is linear time for I go through a loop Once
4. Make Conditions, if it reads the same like a characteristic of a Palindrome, then return a Boolean True or False if the conditions are met
Solution:
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, x: int) -> bool:
        Pal_num = [x for x in str(x)]
        copy = ''.join(Pal_num.copy())
        int_1= int(copy)
        if x < 0:
            reversed_num = -int(str(abs(x))[::-1])
        else:
            reversed_num=int(str(abs(x))[::-1])
        if int_1 == abs(x) and  int_1 == reversed_num:
            return True
        else:
            return False
