Problem:Leetcode 1408
Approach:
You need to break the loop when the match is found because if you say continue it will be an infinite loop, or it will run through the loop 2 times.
Time complexity is n^2 because we have a nested loop.
Solution:
class Solution:
    def stringMatching(self, words: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        res = []
        for i in range(len(words)):
            for j in range(len(words)):
                if i == j:
                    continue
                if words[i] in words[j]:
                    res.append(words[i])
                    break
        return res
