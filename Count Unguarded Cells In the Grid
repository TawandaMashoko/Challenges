Problem: Given 2 Integers m and n representing a 0 indexed (m x n) grid. You are also given 2D integer Arrays guards and walls where guards[i] = [rowsi, coli] and walls[j] = 
[row(j), col(j)] and walls[j] = (row[j], col[j]), to solve this problem, we need to represent the position of the ith guard and the jth wall respectively, the guard can see all
four cardinal directions(north, east, south or west) starting from their position unless obstructed by a wall or another guard. 
A cell is guarded if there is atleast one guard that can see it.
