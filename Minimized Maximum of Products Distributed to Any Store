Problem: n = 6, means we are given 6 different stores, we have products in the form of a quantity array, telling us that we have 2 products [11,6], one product has a quantity of
11 and the other has a quantity of 6.
Explanation:


Code Implementation:
class Solution:
    def minimizedMaximum(self, n: int, quantities: List[int]) -> int:
        def can_distribute(x):
            stores = 0
            for q in quantities:
                stores += math.ceil(q/x)
            return stores <= n
            
        l, r = 1, max(quantities)
        res = 0
        while l <= r:
            x = (l + r) // 2 # l (r - l) // 2
            if can_distribute(x):
                res = x
                r = x - 1
            else:
                l = x + 1
        return res
